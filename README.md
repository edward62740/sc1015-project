# SC1015 Project


## Overview
This repository contains the project files for the SC1015 mini-project.<br>
With the recent increases in fraud and scams around the world, and specifically job scams, we aim to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify job listings as fraudulent or not.
Listed here are the ipynb files used, which should be viewed in numerical order:<br>
1. [EDA](https://github.com/edward62740/sc1015-project/blob/master/EDA.ipynb)
2. [Data Cleaning, NLP](https://github.com/edward62740/sc1015-project/blob/master/Data%20Cleaning%2C%20Lemmatization%20and%20Feature%20Extraction.ipynb)
3. [Support Vector Machine (SVM) model](https://github.com/edward62740/sc1015-project/blob/master/Support%20Vector%20Machine.ipynb)

## ML Models and Performance
Below is the table denoting various performance statistics for the respective models on the test set (for the positive class, i.e. fraudulent)<br>
| Model     | Accuracy | F1   | Recall (TPR) | Specificity (TNR) | Precision |
|-----------|----------|------|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| LinearSVC | 0.988    | 0.88 | 0.815        | 0.997             | 0.95      |
|           |          |      |              |                   |           |
|           |          |      |              |                   |           |
